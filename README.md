<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The program deals with the compressed row, compressed column, and coordinate format of sparse matrix representation and its manipulation. Compressed sparse matrix formars stores the sparse matrixes in much more efficient way with reduced space requirements. The theory in detail has been provided at [SparseDataStructs](./SparseDataStructs.pdf) file .The entire program is written in three files - `client.c`, `header.c`, and `implement.c`. Comments have been added frequently to help in understanding the logic behind implementation. The program has five functions pertaining one to each question and two additional functions to sort and input data to matrices. Refer [Problem statement](./Problem Statement.pdf) file for detailed information.

### Built With
This project was built with 

* C
* Ubuntu 18.04.1 
* gcc version 7.4.0



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Clone the repository into a local machine using

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vineeths96/Sparse-Matrix
```

### Instructions to run

Open the terminal, make the program and run it. 

```shell
make
./a.out
```

Enter the values from the file (or custom values) as requested during exectuion of the program.

### Testcases

The [testcase.txt](./testcase.txt) contains the 5 test cases. Comments have been added to guide through the test case file to identify where to input data.
